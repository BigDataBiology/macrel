# Frequent Asked Questions - FAQ

### Does Macrel detect post-translationally modified peptides?

Currently, Macrel only detects mature peptides. We expect to develop and test
approaches to mask sequences such as leaders or signal peptides too in the next
versions of the program.
    
### Does Macrel detect peptides of any length?

Currently, Macrel detects peptides in the range of 10-100 residues. The
classifier will generally not return meaningful result for longer sequences.
